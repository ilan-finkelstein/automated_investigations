These are the initial code for an automated investigation process to  determine if an IP address is related to a cloud provider or Barracuda and to send the determination to a slack channel. The postman version is intended to be used without an api gateway, eliminating the need to kick off the initial alert in CudaLogs. These are to be considered v1 and will updated to perform judgements and then communicate with a second lambda that will handle slack comms.
